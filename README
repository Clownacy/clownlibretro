Here's my stupid little libretro frontend.

Its input layout is hardcoded, it doesn't fully implement the libretro
specification, it's unfinished, and it's not intended for general use.

Don't use this.

As for a licence - hell if I know.
I guess it's public-domain or MIT-0, choose whichever you like.
