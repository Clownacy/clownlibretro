Here's my stupid little libretro frontend.

Its input layout is hardcoded, it doesn't fully implement the libretro
specification, it's unfinished, it's not intended for general use, and
I'm pretty sure it's limited to Linux/POSIX/Unix-like platforms.

Don't use this.

As for a licence - hell if I know.
I guess it's public-domain or MIT-0, choose whichever you like.
